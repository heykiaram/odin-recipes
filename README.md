## Welcome to my first project! 
### In this project, I learned how to...
- create a new repo
- clone the repo onto my local machine via `git clone`
- write a `README.md`
- commit early and often using the VSCode terminal
- push commits to my created repo
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit .`
    - `git push origin main`
    - `git status`
    - `git log`

### I also learned how to...
- create new directories using the command line `mkdir examplefolder`
- create new files using the command line `touch examplefile.ext`
- insert an `img` with `alt` text on an HTML file
- create unordered and ordered lists for recipe ingredients and steps
- create an `index.html` page housing links to 3 recipes
- deploy/view my project on the web using `your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name`
    - repo *Settings* -> *Pages* -> change *Branch* to *main* -> *Save*
