<p>Ensaymadas are a filipino pastry made with brioche dough that is rolled with butter and sugar to make a small bun. Each bun is then topped with more butter, sugar, and a special type of Edam cheese called queso de bola. They're often eaten as breakfast or a sweet afternoon snack in the Philippines.</p>
